This repo contains Kyle's code for his ICME Xplore project with Sandia.

The purpose of this project is to detect changes in the performance of ice sheet simulations. We use CUSUM and generalized likelihood methods to identify change points, and overlay them on a graph of historical run times. See CUSUM_Interactive.html for an example.
